Demo: [**Audio Degradation JS**](https://ljoglar.github.io/audio-degradation-js/)

JavaScript version of the [**Audio Degradation Toolkit**](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/audio-degradation-toolbox "Audio Degradation Toolkit").

This a work in progress.

This project is been developed in the context of a research project (in collaboration with the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg) of Universitat Pompeu Fabra) to create an automated system to detect Audio Problems in music recordings. This project is the continuation of the a previous work made in 2018 resulting in [Audio Problems Detection algorithms](https://essentia.upf.edu/algorithms_reference.html#audioproblems) included in the Open Soure C++ Audio Library [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/) and the [publication of a paper](https://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=20338) in the 146th AES Convention (March 2019).
